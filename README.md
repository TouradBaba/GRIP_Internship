# GRIP Internship Tasks

This repository contains implementations of three simple machine learning tasks performed as part of the GRIP (Graduate Rotational Internship Program) with the sparks foundation using Python and popular libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib.

## Tasks Overview

1. **Linear Regression Task**: Predicting the percentage of a student based on the number of study hours.
2. **Unsupervised Learning Task**: Exploring and clustering the Iris dataset to predict the optimum number of clusters.
3. **Decision Tree Classifier Task**: Creating and visualizing a decision tree classifier using the Iris dataset.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or later
- Jupyter Notebook or any other Python environment
- Required Python packages: scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

## Files

- `GRIP_Task_1.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook file containing the implementation of linear regression for predicting student scores based on study hours.
- `GRIP_Task_2.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook file containing the implementation of unsupervised learning for clustering the Iris dataset.
- `GRIP_Task_3.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook file containing the implementation of a decision tree classifier for predicting Iris flower species.


## Installation

You can install the required Python packages using pip. Run the following commands:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
```

Make sure you have Python 3.10 or later installed on your system before running the above commands.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/TouradBaba/GRIP_Internship.git
   ```

2. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook files using your preferred Python environment.
